      description:
        "This was my first project. I kept the methods as I originally implemented them, without improving them after gaining more experience, because I wanted to compare my progress across each project.",

      link: "https://github.com/Steph7478/Animista-Website",
      description:
        "This was my third project. I decided to make a copy of the Animista website to learn more about React hooks, understand animations, and explore optimization and organization techniques. So far, this has been my best project (besides my portfolio), where I can showcase my experience with these tools after completing all my projects. I chose to build it without any libraries to understand the fundamentals of each new method I used, so that later I could use libraries more effectively. For example, in this portfolio, I am using libraries.",

        "This project was built with Next.js to take advantage of optimized routing and performance, and I used clsx to organize the UI more efficiently. Itâ€™s a fullstack application focused on selling a browser extension I developed. Throughout the development, I learned a lot about backend development and API handling.",
